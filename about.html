This art project aims at showing controllers from a citizen perspective.<p>A mobile app was developed to take pictures of human faces while smartphones are scanned. Think of it as a selfie app running in the background, making use of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology>dual-use</a> technology: AI and face recognition (it will be published and open-sourced in a near future). The app takes pictures when a face is recognized by the selfie camera while a QR-code is displayed on the screen. This app is installed on the smartphones of an European artist crew, hence the diversity of locations.<p>Since mid-2021, EU opted for smartphones as the prefered way of storing digital COVID certificates. While being convenient, how can controler smartphones be trusted? How can citizen assert that they're not recorded nor filmed by controler smartphones? How is data stored, shared and reselled after being scanned, and with which 3rd parties? The topic isn't bound to COVID certificates and exist for all digital tickets.<p>Technology is the root cause of these privacy concerns, not the answer.<hr><p>Press inquiries: <a href=mailto:ticketspleasepleaseplease@hotmail.com>ticketspleasepleaseplease@hotmail.com</a>.<hr><p>Quotes from Michel Foucault, George Orwell, <a href=https://twitter.com/Snowden/>Edward Snowden</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/julianassange_>Julian Assange</a>.<br>Glitch effect from <a href=https://github.com/codrops/CSSGlitchEffect>Codrops</a>.<hr><p style=text-align:center><a href=/>‚Üê back</a></div>
