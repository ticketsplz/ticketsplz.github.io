Its success is proportional to its ability to hide its own mechanisms.","We are freer than we think.","What I seek is a permanent opening of possibilities.","Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.","Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.","In a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act.","All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.","War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.","Every generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.","The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.","The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.","If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.","The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.","If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human faceâ€”for ever.","But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.","We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.","Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.","If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.","Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.","Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.","In the face of pain there are no heroes.","Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one.","Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.","Big Brother is Watching You.","It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words.","Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else.","Under observation, we act less free, which means we effectively are less free.","The government should be afraid of the people, the people shouldn't be afraid of the government.","And so the geek inherited the earth.","Hemingway once wrote, the way to make people trustworthy is to trust them.","Even if you're not doing anything wrong, you are being watched and recorded.","No system of mass surveillance has existed in any society that we know of to this point that has not been abused.","Sometimes the scandal is not what law was broken, but what the law allows.","Big Brother is home. He is installed in the item you just dragged home from the Apple store.",];var pictures=[];const all_pictures=["03aeec35863f5819a45eb736f740b772","0a175a6c800f8d4fa1e18639515863c0","1025726bb5218972aa6b652762ff6987","12167997e9e27d50c6d5e33ff3456552","126e9f449f9f152b4f93fbb2453dd640","149dd18a8ac25937234eda9b834c3415","1976e36d87879627fb6f87683f6d3a2d","1bc70025ef5e729873db81993c41bdaf","1e22beb1db9adb2877443b611416ddb4","2c228071b3fde8c936dcfa9bd1040a28","3037b4c1203000f7a70211892b6ffd92","30acb5bcaf61470fdebea7545e337030","3226cca5be2a63e388a8f86e57d5e8ca","352b314fad3b90953b3dbb61b2872e90","3aff9b5dbc17ec8303b9a0a9b4bfebcb","3b55ac565f4574047a549d897e989a1a","3d5c614f7f4d3031edfe7e60e10bf1ba","3dcbe315ecb505069114fcc6952c29c5","466cdebaf0173081a5727f41c508c00e","471e7b173a1fd1e62ec96d57870e6b90","474db14ddfb03a673d44e987446e5799","4b0809e6e378fc9ec5ae63e7db39427c","4f7701fd34c051d347ae067ec044cec5","5199f287221ce30fbe07fdd538df37a7","577c4606ca18e5d7ee84722ee4e2a6fc","5798636f1b6d431dd1463e0737439c28","5c59fa9cb444ea2d61278a3165ed7aaf","5c94a72cba6df2f53d316a2e5b8fe295","6d2e31da2697c7ec385b74c4d6e388d8","7b420038faa8d3dfb62302960b265b0f","7e3a8926d340223d5ef2ffd7a3e83c1f","7ea33a4f6c9f8c86d4015a4cf2ca5183","7f4cb328e3a8c7251e7f30e56b0d18f2","82f0ca56b973226f3281c39af6edb850","837ff2d08c0f84c1465ee7d220e53c8c","8850c0afceb55c67dad6e41f778cba33","92ab600c1db2f4443131f8ea7601af64","94b1dfb38f4d605dd4b9b2c30e8785c4","960755364be2632838e077b7be5c5c64","96cc7908ec9ce89861d80b2d35cd092d","9d0a6bfb6db8c5a3312e520382a825da","a26723b9e8802a3d70ad1eac26e9c1e8","a2ecfd943ee97a69759e15e621d0c3f1","a3d067504a43a5b9201116c36ac705f9","a6199c706bc00728542600895d1939df","a61f3d1bdb595c0f36d78665426d49a1","abb7a2c4fab4bf220023919c491b9a30","abe6d37bd1fd907785d5522021b26be6","ac85a3bf836d7cb7eca62b5a2f117e48","aeae7ab1c39d403474277e11a20a6742","b67cfcde01e6f6ddf2d726ad12d5d1a7","b95ca8ded7bb9f371ff7c944a1e4cab1","b9f62f622e95813245e5d3d84ff5cb1c","bb7c9cb8c4be2a53a850e6edf1bb07e2","c2d2908d2e888df4b27f095ca990be17","c52bcb85ab86c759bbf75713802f1900","c534686dfb369076bcf762bfe3e68ee0","c617da9e406cc6a4ac3de2ab047cb60c","cea2cbc507bdc2d52933471e1b524669","d169c77d9a4e27ad09e85d04bb5eabb8","d607dd7c3f7eba261aab51b078f7372e","de29fc3dc36094bc47f30e076d63d2bc","e0d82ddabf6ef33cc2c9201a5f8abc9b","e26fca48b79382f26cfc014e986268d4","e7617d957915bf9266dbe87ca462deea","e90ee078fef389efa0b24cb49f5d15fc","e9e90422795b49a17cb83d20fe887b5b","eff59a3e11d7dbb1357fbf73b5fff8fd","f364d637956fef6fbfbef1a9310585b1","f38cfdc346283e1043e55dbaf68d02a4","f42bf8566b9ba80814cb80d301fb0425","f4639eb83e5b341ab31673f2176e6424","f679895036510b1e26f3051982c9ea00","f7b897e4395b01ec231a1750e1b3dcb0","f908514151221044f011196a2928d04c","fcb2f1fa189d88a8e90b8e8538b070d5","fe5dadf144e02b3debd6c1fcc5cf7e04",];function pick_element(all,available){if(available.length==0){let shuffled=all.map((value)=>({value,sort:Math.random()})).sort((a,b)=>a.sort-b.sort).map(({value})=>value)
